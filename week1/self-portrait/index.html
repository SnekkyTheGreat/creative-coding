    <p>Hi there, I'm Snekky! I make stuff on the internet, including art, webcomics, and fanfiction. <br>I'm a minor, and do not wish to disclose my age. <br> My current obsession is FNaF.<br>
    Offline, I like to design and make cosplays and halloween costumes, <br>and currently have made cosplays of the Golden Guard (TOH), <br>c!Ranboo, Teen Michael Afton, Evan/Chris/C.C. Afton.<br> In progress cosplays are Puppet and Mangle. <br>Upcoming/potential cosplays are DJ Music Man, <br>Funtime Freddy, Funtime Foxy, and Scrap Baby.</p>
    <br>
    <p>You can find me at these places, although my activity is varied.<br>
